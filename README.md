## Setup

After you clone this project, you can open the folder `tech_start_pro` in your favourite IDE or code editor.

### Docker

If you prefer, there's a docker ready option that will build and run the application with one single command.

You must have Docker and Docker Compose installed for this option two work.

Obs: Make sure you're in the right folder. The main project folder (`tech_start_pro`), which contains the `docker-compose.yaml` file.

```
docker-compose up -d
```

You can now access the application and full API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/`.

### Virtual Environment

To setup the virtual environment (i'm using pipenv here) you must run the following commands on your preffered terminal:

Obs: Make sure you're in the right folder. The main project folder (`tech_start_pro`), which contains the `manage.py` file.

Install Pipenv:

```
pip install pipenv
```

Install Dependencies:

```
pipenv install
```

### Env File

Now, you need to create a file named `.env` inside the project folder. You can find an example of how your file should look like bellow or in the file `sample.env`.

```
SECRET_KEY=SOME-SECRET-KEY # Must be a random generated string
```

### Populating Our Database

Next you will run the migrations, django will create a SQLite file and populate it with our tables. It sounds complicated, but we only need one command ðŸ˜€.

Obs: Make sure you're in the right folder. The main project folder (`tech_start_pro`), which contains the `manage.py` file.

```
python manage.py migrate
```

## Running The Application

Use the following command:

Obs: Make sure you're in the right folder. The main project folder (`tech_start_pro`), which contains the `manage.py` file.

```
python manage.py runserver
```

... and that's it!

You can now access the application and full API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/`.

## Importing Categories

You can import categories from a csv file. The csv file has to follow the structure shown bellow.

```
name
Toys
Cellphones
Computers
```

To import a csv file, you'll have to use the following command:

```
python manage.py import_categories <path_to_csv_file>
```

Obs: Make sure you're in the right folder. The main project folder (`tech_start_pro`), which contains the `manage.py` file.

The proccess may take a while, depending on the size of the file you're importing. At the end, it will output `Finished!` in the terminal, to let you know everything went right. If there's any duplicate categories, you'll see a warning telling you which category is duplicated, but it will not interrupt the process nor write duplicates to the database.

## API Documentation

You can access the API documentation by visiting `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`, if you didn't change the default port, or accessing the deployed version at Heroku [here](http://olist.matheusabreu.dev.br/).

## Testing

### Running Tests

Run all tests with coverage:

Obs: Make sure you're in the right folder. The main project folder (`tech_start_pro`), which contains the `manage.py` file.

```
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
```

Generate coverage report:

```
coverage report
```
